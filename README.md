**Abstract**
* *As we enter a time where the impressive perfor-
mance gains promised by Dennard Scaling paired with
Moore’s Law waver. The thermal and power con-
straints modern day processors face continue to grow.
Due to these constraints, a significant portion of on-
chip transistors cannot be powered simultaneously –
an actuality we call Dark Silicon. As this growing chal-
lenge affects every layer of the processor design stack,
forcing architects and developers to seek solutions that
mitigate the impact of these dark transistor regions.
This case study presents a taxonomy that categorizes
existing approaches to tackling Dark Silicon, offering
a structured view to offer insight into the current state
of Dark Silicon mitigation strategies and guiding future
innovative efforts.* *
